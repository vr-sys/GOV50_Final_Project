## Project thoughts

I am interested in data related to what factors influence mental health. I am especially interested in whether social or biological factors have the greatest influence. I am planning on narrowing down possible mitigating factors of mental illnesses - such as religion, family, income, overall physical health, and educational or economic opportunity - and observe whether or not they affect mental health in young college-aged individuals.
